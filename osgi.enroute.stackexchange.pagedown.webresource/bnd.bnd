Bundle-Description: \
	PageDown is the JavaScript Markdown previewer used on Stack Overflow and the rest of \
	the Stack Exchange network. It includes a Markdown-to-HTML converter and an \
	in-page Markdown editor with live preview. The largest part is based on work by \
	John Fraser, a.k.a. Attacklab. He created the converter under the name \
	Showdown and the editor under the name WMD. See this post on the \
	Stack Exchange blog (http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/reverse-engineering-the-wmd-editor/) for some historical information.
