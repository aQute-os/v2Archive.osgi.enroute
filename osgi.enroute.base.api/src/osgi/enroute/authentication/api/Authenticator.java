/**
 * An authenticator is a service that can provide an authenticated id.
 * <p>
 * In general, the credentials for an authentication are provided by the user
 * interface, which is quite often in a completely different subsystem. E.g.
 * with a web based UI the credentials are coming from the Javascript app. The
 * actual code that must handle the login process, and thus authenticate, should
 * preferably not be aware of this agreement between the UI and the
 * authenticator.
 * <p>
 * The idea behind this authenticator is that it acts as a conduit between the
 * GUI (wherever it is, and the actual authenticator used. This implies that the
 * interface is quite generic and bland.
 * <p>
 * An authenticator (Mozilla Persona, JAAS login modules, etc) must register an
 * Authenticator service. A party that needs to authenticate, a servlet filter
 * for example, must map the parameters it has (i.e. id/password, browser id,
 * signed token) to a Map. This map is then passed to the authenticator. The
 * source type can specify what the receiver can expect in the map. One source
 * type is the {@link #SERVLET_SOURCE} type, this states that the map must
 * contain all parameters and all headers of a servlet request.
 * <p>
 * The user id is a unique identifier for the local system. The local User Admin
 * can be used to get more information for that user, the key '_id' is assumed
 * to be set to this id. In general, the id should be an email address.
 * <p>
 * In general, security model is that a Servlet Filter handles the login details
 * and then uses the {@link Authority} service to establish a current user (with
 * a current set of roles) as the default user for a thread.
 * <p>
 * How to use this service:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void doFilter(ServletRequest rq, ServletResponse rsp, FilterChain
 * downstream) throws IOException { ... String id = null; Map<String,Object> map
 * = makeMap(rq); for ( Authenticator authenticator : authenticators ) { id =
 * authenticator.authenticate(map,SERVLET_SOURCE, BASIC_SOURCE); if ( id != null
 * ) { authority.call(id, new Callable<Void>() { public Void call() throws
 * Exception { chain.doFilter(rq,rsp); } }); return; } } .... Map
 * <String,Object> makeMap(ServletRequest rq) { // turn the request into a map }
 * }
