/**
 * The AuthorityAdmin service establishes a thread context for a current user.
 * This service allows access to this current user and its available
 * permissions.
 * <p>
 * Permissions are represented as strings. They map to the (misnomer) of role in
 * Java security discussions. A user can have many permissions. Strings are used
 * because this makes it possible to allow other parties, like Javascript, to
 * evaluate the permissions to adjust the UI or do pre-checks; Java permissions
 * make this impossible.
 * <p>
 * Permissions are {@code symbolic} (basically [-_.a-zA-Z0-9]). However, they
 * can contain a place holder for <em>arguments</em>. Arguments are filter
 * wildcard expressions on specified arguments separated by a semicolon ';'.
 * Arguments can use any character except control (<0x20, so also no cr/lf). In
 * the unlikely case you need to match an argument with a ';', use the Unicode
 * 'full width semicolon' (\uFF1B) instead.
 *
 * <pre>
 * 	example.write.file
 *  example.write.file;/tmp/*
 * </pre>
 *
 * Empty or missing places match any argument.
