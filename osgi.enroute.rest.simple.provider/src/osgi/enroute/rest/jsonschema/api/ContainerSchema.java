/**
 * The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These
 * types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays. This object is based on
 * the JSON Schema Specification Draft 4 and uses a predefined subset of it. On
 * top of this subset, there are extensions provided by this specification to
 * allow for more complete documentation. Further information about the
 * properties can be found in JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation.
 * Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow the JSON Schema
 * specification as referenced here. The following properties are taken directly
 * from the JSON Schema definition and follow the same specifications: $ref - As
 * a JSON Reference format (See Data Type Formats for further details) title
 * description (GFM syntax can be used for rich text representation) default
 * (Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined type for the
 * Schema Object) multipleOf maximum exclusiveMaximum minimum exclusiveMinimum
 * maxLength minLength pattern maxItems minItems uniqueItems maxProperties
 * minProperties required enum type The following properties are taken from the
 * JSON Schema definition but their definitions were adjusted to the Swagger
 * Specification. Their definition is the same as the one from JSON Schema, only
 * where the original definition references the JSON Schema definition, the
 * Schema Object definition is used instead. items allOf properties
 * additionalProperties Other than the JSON Schema subset fields, the following
 * fields may be used for further schema documentation.
