 * allow for more complete documentation. Further information about the
 * properties can be found in JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation.
 * Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow the JSON Schema
 * specification as referenced here. The following properties are taken directly
 * from the JSON Schema definition and follow the same specifications: $ref - As
 * a JSON Reference format (See Data Type Formats for further details) title
 * description (GFM syntax can be used for rich text representation) default
