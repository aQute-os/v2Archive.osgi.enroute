## Introduction

This is a clone of the v2Archive.osgi.enroute repository. It has been moved to the biz.aQute group
to prevent clashes, however, the packages and project names are not changed.

This repository will be maintained to fix bugs and update versions. However, the intention is to
move to all the interesting projects to [biz.aQute.osgi.util] in the bizQute namespace. Several
projects in the v2Archive enRoute have now become OSGi specs so they are more or less abandoned.
